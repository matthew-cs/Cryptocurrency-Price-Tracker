*Changes to be made in Cryptocurrency-Price-Tracker-V2:*
1. Display coin data in columns instead of being clustered together.
2. Add coin ranking on left side of coin-symbol.

Note: the goal is to make a clone of popular crypto exchange websites like https://coinmarketcap.com/ and https://www.coingecko.com/
